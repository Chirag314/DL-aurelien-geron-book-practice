Project Overview:

  - This project explores a dataset containing housing information to analyze features, visualize relationships, and prepare data for potential machine learning tasks.

Key Steps:

Data Loading and Preparation:

    Downloads and extracts the housing dataset from a GitHub repository.
    Splits the data into training and test sets using stratified sampling to ensure representative income distribution.
    Creates a copy of the training set for exploration and further processing.
Data Exploration and Visualization:

    Generates histograms of numerical attributes to visualize distributions.
    Creates scatter plots to visualize geographical patterns and correlations.
    Calculates and visualizes correlations between numerical attributes.
    
Feature Engineering:

    Adds new features like rooms per house, bedrooms ratio, and people per house to potentially enhance predictive power.
Handling Missing Values:

    Demonstrates different approaches to handle missing values:
    Dropping rows with missing values in a specific attribute.
    Dropping the entire attribute with missing values.
    Filling missing values with the median using Scikit-Learn's SimpleImputer.'
    
Dependencies:

    pandas
    NumPy
    matplotlib
    tarfile
    urllib.request
    sklearn.model_selection
    sklearn.impute
Further Exploration:

    Experiment with different feature engineering techniques.
    Apply various machine learning algorithms to predict housing values.
    Evaluate model performance and identify key factors influencing housing prices.
